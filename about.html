                    Hi, there!<br>
                    I've been living my life as Elizabeth Widiasri for about almost 25 by the end of this year.<br>
                    Sounds kind of odd right? I mean the way I say it?<br>
                    I know, I know. Others won't naturally spill words in that manner.<br>
                    But, yea, there's so much to tell and here goes the story of me.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am in thirst of a life guidance since the day my dad passed away 3 years ago.
                    I've always drown into any kind of things related to inner growth and I remember asking
                    "why did I do the way I did?" "why do I perform in a certain behavior while others do their own?"
                    what is rulling in how to live?" "why is there so many contradictions in society?" "what and where to look up?"
                    on and on I'm searching for a liberating answer relentlessly since my junior high age until It come revealing Itself
                    in such an escalating way right when I'm ready to receive it to a degree where I can comprehend.
                    My journey to be back to Myself started around the end of 2017 with a self healing theraphy after experiencing a profound pain to my "persona" self. 
                    Along the way of healing I learned about the Divine Source and The Essence through a self discernment reflection journal, enneagram and transformation, 
                    sacred space visualization, tai-chi meditation, salute to the sun, energy polarity bodywork theraphy and meet a Crystal Indigo Child from Spain
                    who was born connected to the universal matrix of the cosmos, who raised amongst the Mayan culture, and who help me unblocking my aura.
                    Since then I feel empowered for being able to transform my wound into strength and have helped others to foster their healing process.
                    For my experience are seem to be always revolving around those thing I became realize that I love to work with people-their soul.
                    I enjoy immersing myself in community and I can't stop helping people for healing to transcends their Level of Consciousness into enlightment.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    But as the day unfolds, frankly now I have to tell, I gusess that I'm dormant.
