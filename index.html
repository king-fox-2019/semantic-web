  <body>
    <nav>
      <h2>Nav</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It shows top level parts of your whole page map</li>
        <li>
          As it implies, it should be used to help user navigate through your
          website.
        </li>
        <li>
          And so in any page in your website, this part should look and stay the
          same.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
    <header>
      <h1>Semantic HTML</h1>
      <h2>Header</h2>
      <p>
        This part, in which the page title took place, is a semantic element
        called <code>header</code>. It serves as the title of the page.
      </p>
    </header>
    <aside>
      <h2>Aside</h2>
      <p>
        This part usually placed on the left or right side (or both!) of the
        page flow. It serves almost like <code>nav</code>, but it's oftenly used
        to help user navigate in active page, and so could be different each
        page.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <main>
      <h2>Main</h2>
      <p>
        This is the main part of your page. It holds almost every page-related
        contents of your web.
      </p>
      <article>
        <h3>Article</h3>
        <p>
          This is oftenly used in an article page. As it's name implies, this
          element should hold main text part of your page.
        </p>
      </article>
      <section>
        <h3>Section</h3>
        <p>
          Usually, in the <code>main</code> element, you probably still need
          some separation for different context and parts.
          <code>section</code> serves this purpose of enabling you to separate
          your content to more cleaner and maintainable sections.
        </p>
      </section>
    </main>
    <footer>
      <h2>Footer</h2>
      <p>
        This is the last part of every page. It often holds general information
        about the website itself, contacts, copyrights, etc.
      </p>
    </footer>
